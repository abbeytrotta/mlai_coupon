### Data Analyzed
The data being analyzed in this project came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It represents survey data regarding whether a driver will accept a coupon for a bar, restaurant or coffee shop and possible factors that may impact a driver's decision.


### Findings
The greatest individual factor found that impacts the coffee shop coupon acceptance rate was whether a driver had visited a coffee shop 4 or more times. These individuals had a coupon acceptance rate of 67.5%. Combining this population with the drivers heading some place other than home or work, and having an income of under 50k per year brought the acceptance rate up to 73.7%

the greatest individual factor found that impacts the bar coupon acceptance rate was whether a driver had been to a bar 4 or more times. These individuals had a coupon acceptance rate of 76.9%

The factors that led to the highest coffee shop coupon acceptance rates were:

- The driver visited a coffee shop 4 or more times
- The driver is heading someplace other than work or home
- The driver is heading in the same direction as the coffee shop
- The driver has an income of under 50k

The factor that led to the highest bar coupon acceptance rate was:

- The driver visited a bar 4 or more times

The greatest success rate in coupon usage will come from drivers who fall into one or more of the categories listed under actionable items.
